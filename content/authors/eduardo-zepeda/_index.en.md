## A little bit more about me

I learned almost all that I know about web developing [by reading and practicing this pile of books](en/pages/books-i-read-and-reviews/). I even reviewed some of them. Lately I've been experimenting with online platforms like: [Educative](https://educative.io/#?), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/#?) and [Platzi](https://platzi.com/#?) too.

I possess the [Microsoft AZ-900 Fundamentals Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/17608a52-2cb7-4268-a907-613459559911/public_url)

I'm a fan of solving katas on [Codewars](/en/i-test-chatgpt-with-codewars-coding-challenges/). I'm 2 kyu now!

I'm proficient developing in GNU/Linux environments (I'm a obsessed Debian user since late 2010).

## My non-tech hobbies ~~oh no! I'm a weeb!~~

I am passionate about art cinema, anime and manga. I have a deep affection for videogames, however I have become picky when it comes to choose a new title to play. 

**I'm a fervant reader**, mainly science fiction. However I also enjoy reading science essays, blogs, books on technology, business and philosophy. I'm a proud coffee nerd that is keen to find promising places to drink coffee.

**I am a teetotaler and do not smoke**.
