## A little bit more about me

Graduated from CUCEI. I learned almost all that I know about web developing [by reading and practicing the content enclosed in this pile of books](/en/pages/books-i-read-and-reviews/), I even reviewed some of them. However, lately I've been experimenting with online platforms like: [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/#?) and [Platzi](https://platzi.com/#?) too, still prefer books though.

I possess a [Microsoft AZ-900 Fundamentals Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/17608a52-2cb7-4268-a907-613459559911/public_url#?)

Wanna see some client and personal projects? Check out my [portfolio on my personal website](https://zeedu.dev), sorry only some of them are OSS.

I'm a obsessed Linux user since late 2010.

I've been solving katas on [Codewars](/en/i-test-chatgpt-with-codewars-coding-challenges/). I'm 2 kyu now, just one more Kyu to go!

## My non-tech hobbies ~~oh no! I'm a weeb!~~

I feel passion towards art cinema, anime and manga. A deep affection for videogames lives within my heart, however I've become picky when it comes to choose a new title to play. 

~~I'm a nerd~~ **I'm a fervant reader**, mainly science fiction, lately I'm a fan of Greg Egan and Ted Chiang. Furthermore I also enjoy reading science essays, blogs, books on technology, business topics and philosophy. Science is elegant.

I'm a proud coffee nerd that is keen to find promising places to drink good quality coffee.

**I am a teetotaler and do not smoke**.
