## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Coffee Bytes ("we," "us," "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about the information we collect. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your personal information when you visit our website, https://coffeebytes.dev (the "Site"), a blog about technology and programming.

We do not require any form of registration for you to read our content. We only collect personal data in one specific circumstance: if you voluntarily subscribe to our newsletter.

By using our Site, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

To provide clarity and reassurance, we want to explicitly state what we do **not** do:

*   We do not require user accounts or registration to read our blog.
*   We do not allow users to comment on posts, and therefore we do not collect any user data for that purpose.
*   We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties for their commercial purposes.

## 3. Information We Collect and How We Use It

### A. Information Collected Automatically (Non-Personal Data)

Like most websites, we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our Site. This data is collected through cookies and similar technologies and is used for analytical purposes to understand how our content is performing and to improve the user experience.

This may include:
*   **Usage Data:** Information about how you use the Site, such as the pages you visit, the time spent on those pages, and navigation paths. This is collected via Google Analytics and PostHog.
*   **Technical Data:** Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.

This information is aggregated and anonymized. It cannot be used to identify you personally. For more details, please see our [Cookie Policy](/en/pages/politica-de-cookies/).

### B. Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us (Personal Data)

**Newsletter Subscription**
The only personal data we collect is the information you provide explicitly and voluntarily when you sign up for our email newsletter, which we manage using **Mailchimp** (a service provided by The Rocket Science Group LLC).

*   **What we collect:** Your email address.
*   **Why we collect it:** To send you our newsletter, which contains updates on new blog posts, technology news, and programming tips.
*   **Legal Basis:** We process this data based on your explicit consent, which you provide at the time of subscription.

## 4. How We Share Your Information

We value your privacy. We will only share your personal information in the following limited circumstances:

*   **Service Providers:** We share your email address with **Mailchimp**, our email marketing provider, solely for the purpose of delivering the newsletters you requested. Mailchimp is a third-party data processor and its use of your information is governed by its own Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review Mailchimp's [Privacy Policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).
*   **Legal Obligations:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

## 5. Data Retention

*   **Automatically Collected Data:** Non-personal, aggregated analytics data is retained for a period determined by our analytics providers (Google Analytics and PostHog), which is typically between 26 and 50 months.
*   **Newsletter Data:** We will retain your email address for as long as you remain subscribed to our newsletter. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link at the bottom of every email we send. Upon unsubscribing, your email address will be removed from our active mailing list, though Mailchimp may retain it in a suppression list to ensure we do not accidentally re-add you in the future.

## 6. Your Data Protection Rights

Depending on your location, you have rights under data protection laws. These may include the right to:

*   **Access:** Request copies of your personal data.
*   **Rectification:** Request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate.
*   **Erasure (The "Right to be Forgotten"):** Request that we erase your personal data.
*   **Restrict Processing:** Request that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
*   **Object to Processing:** Object to our processing of your personal data.
*   **Data Portability:** Request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you.
*   **Withdraw Consent:** Where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [Your Email Address]. We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by applicable law.

## 7. International Data Transfers

Our newsletter provider, Mailchimp, is based in the United States. Your information (email address) may be transferred to and processed in the United States. Mailchimp complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and other legal mechanisms to ensure an adequate level of protection for international data transfers.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Our Site is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 16 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from Children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We will also inform registered subscribers of any material changes via email. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
