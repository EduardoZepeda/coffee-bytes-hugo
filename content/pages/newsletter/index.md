You can subscribe to my newsletter and I'll let you know of new posts. I publish often, from two to four times per month, no more, no less.  
However, I don't have time to manage two newsletters so I won't translate it to english, but if you're interested in practicing your spanish skills go on. You have my zero spam promise, besides you can cancel your subscription at any time.
