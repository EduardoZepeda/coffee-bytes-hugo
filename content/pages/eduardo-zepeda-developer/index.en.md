Hi, I'm Eduardo Zepeda, self-taught web developer. I learned all I know about programming from [these books, which I've read and reviewed](en/books-ive-read-and-reviews/). Lately, I've been taking online courses on Udemy and Platzi (Check out my [platzi certificates](https://platzi.com/@eduardo-zepeda/)).

I'm a huge fan of Codewars, sometimes I solve some Katas there. I reached 2 kyu a few months ago!

My preferred programming languages are:

- **Python**
- **Javascript, Typescript**
- **Go**

Yes, in that particular order

My favorite web frameworks are:

- **Django and DRF**
- **FastAPI (I love its simplicity but I haven't used it in a project, yet)**
- **React, Nextjs and related**
- **Trying Hugo these days**

I feel comfortable developing web applications in GNU/Linux environments (I use Debian distribution since end of 2010)

My personal projects, including this blog, use [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/a22240ebb8e7) VM (called droplets) for the hosting, however I've deployed on other platforms like Vercel or Netifly.

I'm a big fan of art films, anime and manga, specially horror and sci fi genres, I usually watch a few art films, carefully chosen (maybe not so much) every week, on mubi. I love to play videogames, nevertheless I'm very selective about those I decide to play. I love reading, specially sci fi, and also scientific essays, blogs, technology. I'm into speciality coffee and coffee shops.

I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I guess you could say I'm your classic bookworm.
