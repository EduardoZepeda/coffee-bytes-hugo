## Use of Affiliate links

This is a personal blog that exists for the purpose of sharing my passion for technology with the web, and helping with a grain of salt to this community that has given me so much.

We do use affiliate links as a way to help us support the running of this blog. I try to diminish the costs of maintaining this blog, since I'm not charging for the content and I appreciate every little bit of help I can get.

Affiliate marketing is a widely used practice and some of the biggest brands on the planet use it. This includes the likes of Amazon.

If you click on one of these links and make a purchase, we may make a small commission that doesn't change the price for you.

We’re careful about the products/services we recommend and if we believe that they hold no value – we won’t recommend them.

With that in mind, you should assume that all links are affiliate links and do your own due diligence before making a purchase. What’s right for us, may not be the perfect solution for you. It’s important to figure out what you want to achieve, this will make any purchase decisions far easier.
