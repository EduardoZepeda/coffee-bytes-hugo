The other day, one of the youtubers I follow recommended a page to receive algorithms by email How would you like to receive one algorithm problem a day in your email? That's 7 problems per week and 365 problems per year. Imagine how much it would improve your problem solving and analytical skills. Still not enough? What if I told you that these code puzzles are frequently asked questions in job interviews at top world-class technology companies?

## One day, one challenge

To receive an algorithm problem, just send us an e-mail. The problems do not test your knowledge of syntax, nor the number of functions or libraries of any specific language, but your problem solving skills. The people in charge of the page (although I think it is only one) claim, **although there is no way to corroborate it**, that the problems presented are obtained from job interviews at Google, Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, among others.

## My experience with challenges

I subscribed to your list some time ago and currently receive your challenges by email. There are some that have taken me a couple of minutes to find the algorithm to solve and for others I have had to ponder the problem for several hours to come up with a solution. It's addictive, that's for sure.

But, there is bad news; the solutions do not come to you by email, they are part of the premium package, for a fee, you didn't expect them to work for free, did you? The premium package receives a detailed analysis of the solutions and their efficiency, using [Big O notation](/en/the-big-o-notation/). However, this is by no means an obstacle, as you can find out for yourself whether your solution meets the requirements or not just by reading the content of the email; the efficiency analysis is another story.

## A couple of examples

Curious what the problems are like? Here are a couple of examples of the style of their problems:

> Given a list of numbers and a k number, return if any two numbers from the list sum up to k
> For example: given [10, 15, 3, 7] y k = 17, return true since 10 + 7 = 17
> Bonus: Can you do this on one run?

Here is the second one:

> Given an array of integers, returns a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
> For example, if our array were [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input were [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].


What do you think? Easy or difficult? Leave your opinion or solution to the problems in the comments. I will probably solve one of the problems in a future post.
