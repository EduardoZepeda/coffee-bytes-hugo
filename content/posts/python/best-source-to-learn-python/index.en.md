## The Best books to learn Python

I used these curated resources to learn Python, most of them are books, since I read them, I can heartily recommend them to you. If this little guide can help you to not get lost in the sea of options out there I'll be thrilled to share my experience learning Python with you.

### Dive into Python 3

This book is my favorite of all, it starts from scratch and begins to teach you the syntax of the language by creating small simple programs that even a fool ~~,like me,~~ can understand. The programs are basic but the author doesn't stop there, throughout the book he delves into topics such as: 

- Explanation of how Python transforms bytes into strings
- Efficiency of algorithms at a very basic level
- Generators
- Iterators
- Closures
- Regular expressions
- XML handling
- HTTP requests

In my humble opinion this book is my favorite source for learning Python, I also [wrote a review of dive into Python]({{< ref path="/posts/python/ya-conoces-este-libro-gratuito-de-python-3-en-espanol/index.md" lang="en" >}}) in the past.

### Beggining Python from novice to Professional

Beggining Python from novice to Professional is an introduction to the language from scratch, basically starts with the installation of the Python binary and takes you step by step from syntax, through each of the most common uses of the language, like how to create native graphical interfaces, web servers from scratch using sockets and even some basic frameworks, like [Django web framework]({{< ref path="/posts/django/por-que-deberias-usar-django-framework/index.md" lang="en" >}}).

Highly recommended if you want to get an overview of Python capabilities.

### Cracking Codes with Python

A bit unusual book, it explains the basics of Python while teaching you the history of cryptography. This book also assumes that you know absolutely nothing about Python. The theme of the book is to teach you an encryption method each chapter. 

You will learn how to encrypt and decrypt using Caesar cipher, Vigenere, single-use notebooks and, to wrap the last chapters, the author dwells into the basics of RSA cipher. 

If you are looking for something short, sweet and enjoyable to master the most basic parts of the language this is your book.

### Python Pocket Reference

This little book of about 260 pages is the whole Python programming language in a nutshell, but it is not didactic and is more like a cheatsheet or summary of all the features and subtleties of this programming language. 

I can recommend it, but only if you already have notions of the language, in which case it is an excellent way to reinforce concepts and learn something new. 

The strength of this book is its portability, given its pocket-size you can read it at any leisure time or when you are on the go.

### Python tricks

If you already have some notions of the language, this book will take your skills even further. Python tricks is a compilation of some little known, or overlooked, features of this programming language. What do you mean? Well, things like: 
- The use of zip
- Context managers
- Handling iterators
- Magic methods or dunders 
- Closures 
- Stacks and Queues
- Named tuples

And too many things to cover in a short post. But if you have a chance and a little more experience in the language, I highly recommend you to acquire it.
