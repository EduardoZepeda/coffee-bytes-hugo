title: Dive into Python the Best book to learn python
---

This book was my favorite book to learn Python, even if you're a beginner or have no experience at all. Since this was one of my first approaches to Python my review may be biased, but it's completely authentic.

If you're interested in more books to learn python [here's my list of favorite resources to learn Python]({{< ref path="/posts/python/best-source-to-learn-python/index.md" lang="en" >}})

## What topics are covered in the book?

This book is an introduction to language, designed to explain language and its nuances from the ground up. The first chapters deal with the installation of the language in the main operating systems, as well as its syntax, so don't worry if you're a beginner with no experience at all.

After a couple of chapters, the author develops the topic of Python's native data handling; Booleans, numbers, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, as well as its most common methods. At the end of the brief introduction to the language, the author gives us a walk through more advanced concepts such as:

* Explanation of how Python transforms bytes into text strings.
* Efficiency of algorithms at an entry level
* Generators
* Iterators
* Closures
* Regular expressions
* xml handling
* http requests

The above topics are discussed while searching for a solution to a specific problem. For example: regular expressions are explained by trying to create a function that transforms Roman numerals into Arabic numerals and vice versa, iterators are applied in order to create a small application that transforms words into plural (following the grammatical rules of the English language, of course). 

By treating the topics as small projects, the author raises questions that a programmer may face, such as the dilemma between prioritizing the speed of the code or the memory used by the program. 

At the end of each chapter the author recommends additional material to deepen the concepts discussed throughout the chapter.

## What makes Dive into Python superior?

Well, I consider that, what makes Dive into Python superior is that the book is concise; it attempts to explain the basics and most useful aspects of the language in a concise manner. 

It doesn't cram unnecessary content for the sake of appearing more comprehensive, nor does it fall short. It focuses on teaching what's necessary, unlike other books that attempt to cover the entire language and end up being abandoned by the reader.

## Where do I download or buy Dive into Python?

Dive into Python is one of the best materials you can find on the internet about Python and, if that's not enough, it is licensed under a Creative Commons 3.0 license, which makes it freely available to the general public, of course I'm talking about a digital edition.

If you're interested in adquiring a hard-cover version, you can get [Dive into Python 3 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4oinuzN#?), just make sure you're buying the version that covers Python 3, the one with a 3 on the cover. Also, if you're a Spanish speaker, or want to practice your Spanish skills check this [Dive into Python translation completely for free](https://github.com/jmgaguilera/inmersionenpython3).
