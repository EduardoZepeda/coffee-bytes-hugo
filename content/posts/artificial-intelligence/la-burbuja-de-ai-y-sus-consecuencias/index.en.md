title: The Rise and Fall of the AI Bubble
---

Since ChatGPT rapidly surpassed the record of user growth, artificial intelligence is almost omnipresent in the modern metropolis collectivity. Its arrival has brought a wide gradient of expectations ranging from simple problem solving to the complete automation of our societies. 

{{< styles >}}

But I believe that, while AI has amazing capabilities, it is far from revolutionizing the world and achieving the full automation expected by the general public in the short term.

## Is the AI bubble finally bursting out?

Edit: Builder.AI a promising AI that offered websites created with AI was nothing more than a bunch of India developers working behind the scenes, and [it has just filed for bankruptcy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/builder-ais-shocking-450m-fall-170009323.html). 

This is just another proof that screams that lot of AI businesses are playing hit and run with investor's money. They try to rise the expectations to get money from the angel investors and whoever they can and then just fall epically when they fail to deliver. But at that moment, who cares, money has been made and businesses involve risks so...

Devin AI fell into oblivion. At the same time, we are seeing the law of diminishing returns with each new LLM that appears (video and image generative models have not yet reached that point).

Other companies abandonned the idea of replace developers and focused on becoming tools in code creation, like [Bolt, Lovable o V0]({{< ref path="/posts/artificial-intelligence/bolt-vs-lovable-vs-vercel-v0-mi-opinion/index.md" lang="en" >}})

## Investors' greed and consumers' ignorance are guilty of The AI bubble

It is enough for a company to use AI to grant it with an unknown magic that makes it irresistible to the general public, and also to investors. And this because a simple reason: as a society we do not understand how AI works internally, we do not understand the statistics behind it and we endow it with the mysticism of magic.

Consumers, usually businesses, expect AI to reduce (or eliminate) the costs of hiring people and investors expect to make the investment of a lifetime.

## AI fever and capital investment

As I said, investors don't want to be left out of this party and are so eager to hit the jackpot and become the new Zuckerberg of artificial intelligence that they open their wallets without thinking every time they hear the word "AI" in the same sentence as "disruptive."

{{< figure src="images/wallstreet-is-dumb.jpg" class="md-local-image" alt="Wallstreet has no idea about AI" >}}

But, I'm under the impression that this is all just a bunch of companies and entrepreneurs acting on the above, just as [creators of  Devin, the supposed replacement for programmers]({{< ref path="/posts/artificial-intelligence/devin-de-cognition-labs-la-inteligencia-artificial-que-reemplaza-a-los-programadores/index.md" lang="en" >}}), and the creators of [Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech/#?) are probably doing.

The market is trying to make a quick and easy buck from the suddenly growing interest of tech laymen in something as abstract, and with such esoteric characteristics, as AI.

## Many of the AI solutions are just plain ChatGPT wrappers

In addition to this, most people involved in the financial side of AI don't understand that not much has really changed in the coding world, most solutions just use ChatGPT on the backend, along with a visually appealing interface to present themselves as the next unicorn and look for easy money from investors.

There are even protocols to interact with LLM, like the [Model Context Protocol](/en/artificial-intelligence/understand-the-model-context-protocol-or-mcp-once-and-for-all/).

{{< figure src="images/ai-company-chatgpt.jpg" class="md-local-image" alt="Startups are just a wrapper for chatgpt" >}}

It's not that using chatGPT for your company is wrong, but if an app is just a GPT wrapper, the risk of becoming a commodity is high, are we going to have thousands of different apps that solve the same problem and are just chatGPT wrappers?

And not that the above is wrong, but I would prefer that all the possibilities that AI has to offer be explored, that we train neural networks to automate every tedious aspect of society and free humans from the paradigm of performing repetitive 9-5 tasks or maybe to improve human's health via [drug design](/en/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-drug-design-for-developers/). I want more investment in AI, but one that "adds value," not just seeks to profit as quick as possible.

## Companies are running out of Data to train LLM

I stumbled upon this video the other day, and I agree with this fine gentleman: Companies are running out of data, it was never about computing power, it's all about curated and reliable datasets to train AI. 

{{<youtube "nkdZRBFtqSs">}}

The greed that feeds the use of AI is going to flood the internet with a myriad of AI articles, that are going to be used to feed, and afterwards be regurgitated by the AI, over and over again ~~as in the human centipede movie~~.

## The tragic end of the AI Bubble and the New Normal

Having said the above, it seems that I believe that all this about AI is nothing more than smoke and mirrors, but that's far from the truth, I believe that AI is going to stay and it has potential for a social revolution but, at least in the short term, it will be exclusive to a very small group of companies, among which I highlight openAI, Google, Microsoft and the usual players.

> Machines don’t learn. What a typical “learning machine” does, is finding a mathematical formula, which, when applied to a collection of inputs (called “training data”), produces the desired outputs. This mathematical formula also generates the correct outputs for most other inputs (distinct from the training data) on the condition that those inputs come from the same or a similar statistical distribution as the one the training data was drawn from. - Andriy Burkov

My take is that AI is the ultimate autocompletition tool, be it text, images, video 3D structure (I foresee a huge potential in this field), nothing else. So far AGI is a milestone that remains distant in the future and we don't know if it is achievable.

Don't get me wrong, there is an AI bubble, and the bubble will burst and only those companies with the potential to change the game forever will remain. Tools like Sora, Midjourney, ChatGPT, Eleven Labs or Watson. 

It is up to them to decide the pace at which this transition will take place despite what the market is trying to shove down your throat.

{{< figure src="images/ai-bubble-explosion-meme.jpg" class="md-local-image" alt="dragon ball meme about the AI bubble bursting" >}}

My prediction regarding the AI bubble, is that all other companies that don't have their own unique neural networks or some intellectual property to protect them, are going to cannibalize and commoditize themselves, crashing the market in the process, and that, when the AI bubble bursts, a lot of people are going to lose money in the process.
