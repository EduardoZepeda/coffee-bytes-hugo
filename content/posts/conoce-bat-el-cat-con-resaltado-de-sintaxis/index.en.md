The other day I was looking for syntax highlighting tools and I came across a pretty interesting tool called [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) (Yes, like bat in English), it's basically the linux _cat_ command, but with colors and other pretty interesting functions. And, as icing on the cake, **it's programmed in Rust.** In this post I explain in a short way how it works and what it can do for you.

## Install bat from repositories on linux

You can install it directly from the repositories in newer versions of Debian or derivative systems (Ubuntu).

```bash
sudo apt install bat
```

As my version of Debian is not the most recent one I had to install it from [its version of software package with .deb ending](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases). Remember that if you have problems with GNU/Linux commands go to read my entries where I make you a summary of the [most basic GNU Linux commands](/en/linux-basic-commands-grep-ls-cd-cat-cp-rm-scp//)

```bash
wget https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/download/v0.15.4/bat-musl_0.15.4_amd64.deb
dpkg -i bat-musl_0.15.4_amd64.deb
```

## What is bat for?

_Bat_ will display the contents of a file, just like _cat_, but with the syntax highlighted for most programming languages:

_Cat_, the default tool shows us the file that we indicate but in a single color.

```
cat index.js
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import App from "./App"

ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'))
```

If we now use _bat_ we will see the language syntax highlighted and the line numbers in the standard output:

```javascript
bat index.js
//File: index.js
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import App from "./App"

ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'))
```

You can highlight tabs, spaces and line breaks using the _-A_ option.

```css
bat -A index.css
/*index.css*/
body{␊
••margin: 0;␊
••background-color: whitesmoke;␊
••font-family: Lolita;␊
••font-color: #bbb;␊
}␊
␊
.checkBoxes{␊
••font-size: 20px;␊
••padding: 10px;␊
}
```

## Bat has many topics available

Bat has themes for all tastes, hippies, sober, formal, psychedelic, etc. Use _--list-themes_ to see them.

```javascript
bat --list-themes
...
Theme: Monokai Extended

  // Output the square of a number.
  fn print_square(num: f64) {
      let result = f64::powf(num, 2.0);
      println!("The square of {:.2} is {:.2}.", num, result);
  }
...
```

If you like a particular theme you can temporarily use it to display a file using the _--theme_ option.

```bash
bat --theme='Monokai Extended' index.css
```

To load it permanently you must add it to your _.bash_rc_ file.

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
...
export BAT_THEME="Monokai Extended"
...
```

## Bat comes with an automatic pager.

This means that if the file is enormous, it will not show the whole file, but it will show a part of it and we will be able to move through the content with the arrows on our keyboard. The default pager is _less_.

```bash
#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile
# To update, run:
#
#    pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in
#
amqp==2.2.2
asn1crypto==0.24.0
attrs==17.4.0
Babel==2.5.3
BabelDjango==0.2.2
:
```

## Bat has git integration

Bat integrates with _git_ and shows you the horrible buggy changes you have implemented in your code. It adds a + symbol for added lines and a ~ for modified lines.

```html
{% block content %}
  <header class="navbar" role="navigation">
    ~ <p>Parrafo modificado</p>
    + <p>Parrafo nuevo</p>
  </header>
{% endblock %}
```

What do you think, would you use it? I find it a very useful tool, especially for environments where you don't have a graphical interface or if you are like me and don't like to wait for the IDE to load.
