cloud, in which they explain each part and how it relates to the others.

## How much does certification cost? Is it free?

The certification costs **about $90 USD directly with microsoft**,
but I got it for free as part of a [Platzi learning platform]() certification challenge.

I understand that if you sign up for the Microsoft Learn e-learning platform, they usually
give away coupons from time to time.

With so many coupons and other free options, I don't recommend you to
out of pocket, but rather wait for an opportunity to get it for free or much cheaper.

### Platzi courses

The process consists of completing the following 4 courses:

* Fundamentals of Software Engineering
* Introduction to the Terminal and Command Line Course
* Linux Server Administration Course

In general the first two are fairly easy, especially if you already have experience, the last two do require some experience or a lot of practice on your part to pass them.
