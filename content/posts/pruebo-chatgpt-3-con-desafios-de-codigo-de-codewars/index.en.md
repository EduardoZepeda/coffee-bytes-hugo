ChatGPT is breaking with everything previously known in intelligence.
artificial intelligence, some developers are worried that it could replace them in their jobs, just as Github Copilot
in their jobs, just as Github Copilot threatened at the time. In this
entry I test [ChatGPT's supposed intelligence](/chat-gpt-the-china-room-from-self-knowledge-and-consciousness/) against three codewars challenges.

## How does Codewars work?

Before we start you need to understand that [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is
a social network for programmers to share code challenges written by the same users.
written by the same users. Each challenge can be tested with a series of
series of tests and, if it passes all of them, the challenge is considered completed. These
challenges are called katas.

Each kata has a level of difficulty, defined by its number of kyu (as in
martial arts), with the highest numbers being the easiest and the smallest the most difficult, ranging from the 8th kyu to the 1st kyu.
the most difficult, going from the 8th kyu to the 1st kyu.

The challenges are very varied, ranging from classic tests; such as obtaining prime numbers, to more complex ones; such as writing code without
numbers, to some more complex ones; such as writing code without exceeding two
two characters per line.

## Test with common requests to ChatGPT

To start with, I was testing ChatGPT with a series of simple requests and
popular. I found that ChatGPT was able to return the correct code on each occasion
with its explanation and logical steps:

* Fibonacci numbers
* Prime numbers
* Palindromes
* Validate email, strings, numbers
* Very specific tasks of some frameworks. For example: [Replace User model in Django.
User model in Django](/how-to-customize-user-model-in-django/)

is a CharField.")

Frankly, I am amazed at the capabilities of generating correct code.
that ChatGPT has for simple tasks and with abundant information on the web;
I did not expect such a capability.

For this entry I'm going to test this artificial intelligence with
algorithm puzzles that require a little more than googling information on the internet.
the internet.

## Codewars test selection

For these tests, I tried to choose a middle ground between those tests with
very straightforward requirements and with abundant solutions on the web (such as fibonacci numbers or primes) and those that require a lot of
fibonacci numbers or primes) and those that require a lot of additional information, very complex premises or require extra context.

## ChatGPT vs ¡Gira la matriz en sentido contrario a las agujas del reloj N - veces! (6 kyu)

El desafío de la [prueba Rotate matrix counter - clockwise N -
times!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5919f3bf6589022915000023) es: En este kata
tu misión es girar la matriz en sentido contrario a las agujas del reloj N veces. Es decir, rotar
una matriz contra reloj "n" numero de veces.

El input que usé en ChatGPT para generar el código es el siguiente: Crear una función
que gire una matriz "n" veces en sentido contrario a las agujas del reloj.

![](images/rotate-matrix-ChatGPT.png)

The Python code generated by our Artificial Intelligence is as follows:

```python
# Este código fue generado por OpenAI-ChatGPT
def rotate_matrix(matrix, n):
    # create a new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix
    rotated_matrix = [[0 for j in range(len(matrix[0]))] for i in range(len(matrix))]

    # loop over the elements of the input matrix
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
      for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
        # rotate the element at position (i, j) counter clockwise by n positions
        # and store it in the corresponding position in the new matrix
        rotated_i = (i + n) % len(matrix)
        rotated_j = (j + n) % len(matrix[0])
        rotated_matrix[rotated_i][rotated_j] = matrix[i][j]

    # return the rotated matrix
    return rotated_matrix
```

### Response analysis

After executing the code, we can see that all tests fail, the matrix
rotates, but more times than necessary

![](images/rotate-matrix-codewars.png)

I would like to emphasize that ChatGPT produces syntactically correct code, respecting
with intuitive variable names and even with a logic that seems correct, only at first sight, but that
seems correct, only at first glance, but upon closer examination, fails to "reason" its
detailed examination, fails to "reason" its logic. Yes, I know that artificial intelligences
artificial intelligences do not reason.

## ChatGPT vs Encontrar el enésimo Número Inverso (Extremo)

El desafío [Find the nth Reverse
Number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/600c18ec9f033b0008d55eec) consiste en: Usted
necesita devolver el enésimo número inverso. (Supongamos que los números inversos empiezan por 0
como se muestra en el ejemplo).

That is, find the palindrome number "n" and with the appropriate condition to do so with excellent Big O performance.
to do so with an excellent Big O performance.

```python
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101
```

![](images/palindrome-ChatGPT.png)

### Response analysis

After running the code, I was surprised to find that, after a small
adjustment, the result is correct!

![](images/palindrome-codewars.png)

In addition to producing syntactically correct code, the code generated works
perfectly, it even contains comments.

```javascript
// Este código fue generado por OpenAI-ChatGPT
function findReverseNumber(n) {
  let i = 0n; // initialize a BigInt variable with the value 0
  let found = 0;
  // El ajuste está aquí, n-1 en lugar de n
  while (found < n-1) {
    i++;
    if (isPalindrome(i)) {
      found++;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

function isPalindrome(num) {
  let str = num.toString();
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length / 2; i++) {
    if (str[i] !== str[str.length - i - 1]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

However, there is a small flaw, despite producing the results in a manner
correctly, the code does not pass the tests because the [performance of Big
O](/the-big-notation-big-o/) of the artificial intelligence is insufficient for the
test.

I tried to get the correct answer multiple times, including specifying the
complexity of Big O with different inputs, but it was impossible to get the correct result.
correct result.

## ChatGPT vs Expresión Regular para Números Binarios Divisibles por n (1 kyu)

El desafío de [Expresión regular para números binarios divisibles por
n](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5993c1d917bc97d05d000068) es: Crear una función
que devuelva una cadena de expresión regular capaz de evaluar
cadenas binarias (que constan sólo de 1s y 0s) y determinar si la
cadena dada representa un número divisible por n.

![](images/binary-division-ChatGPT.png)

After asking for a response, we get back a rather simple expression e
even gives us a step-by-step explanation of the logical reasoning, apparently correct but in
apparently correct but, in practice, incorrect.

The regular expression returned as a response is the following:

```javascript
// Este código fue generado por OpenAI-ChatGPT
^[01]+\b(?:$){n}$
```

### Response analysis

When we test it in the codewars tests, it fails, obviously.

![](images/binary-division-codewars.png "An extra pair of curly braces is added to comply with
comply with Python's F string syntax. False positives are due to the
due to the binary character of the response")

## Results and my opinion

The results are summarized in the following table:

| Kata | Result |
| ---- | ------ |
|      | 6 kyu  | ❌     |   |
|      |        | 4 kyu | ✅ |  |
|      |        | 1 kyu | ❌ |  |

While ChatGPT got only one of the challenges right (and only half right) it is capable of
solve simple problems, which could also be solved with a search on google or stackoverflow, this

code that works, not necessarily correct, not necessarily efficient, but close.
close.

ChatGPT becomes rather inefficient with requests that require a
complex reasoning and seems incapable of building a complex system, with many interacting parts.
interacting parts, however, I recognize that, for every question, it is able to return a syntactically

answers can serve as a starting point.

### Is ChatGPT a threat to programmers?

Do I think ChatGPT represents is going to put a lot of jobs on the line? Yes, I think ChatGPT will
I think ChatGPT is going to make it difficult for most jobs (not necessarily code-related) that are not
necessarily those related to code) that are not challenging and whose difficulty lies in simple

requiring simple reasoning. However, I believe that it is not the
the veracity of its answers, but its chat-like interface, and the immediacy of its answers, which could
that could make it quite popular.
