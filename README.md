# Coffee bytes 

My web development blog content in markdown file, prepared to be rendered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It uses [hugo-theme-latte](https://github.com/EduardoZepeda/hugo-theme-latte)

## Installation

First clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduardoZepeda/coffee-bytes-hugo
cd coffee-bytes-hugo/
```

Fetch the main theme updating git submodules. 

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Generate static files

Simply run with a hugo version greater than 0.84.

```bash
hugo
```

Hugo will generate all required files into the *public/* directory.
Since this blogs uses images and Hugo resizes them to different sizes compilation could take a little more than a text based site.
